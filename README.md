# Plasmonic sensor

It's a project which idea came up during graphene hackathon 2023 (Manchester, UK). Plasmonic material is a metamaterial. 
It this project graphene-aluminium-graphene stack was used (actually it was graphite, but for marketing purposes it was called "graphene"). Aluminium was used to enhance optical properties of graphene.

# Goal
The goal was to create a device that could detect light (sensor) and be able to identify its colour using ML model. For training purposes 3 lasers were used (green, red, blue).

#  Software
The sensor is connected to oscilloscope, which is connected to PC. It allows for real-time data acquisition. There is enough data collect to train ML model.
